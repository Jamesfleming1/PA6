# Maze.py
#  original version by db, Fall 2017
#  Feel free to modify as desired.

# Maze objects are for loading and displaying mazes, and doing collision checks.
#  They are not a good object to use to represent the state of a robot mazeworld search
#  problem, since the locations of the walls are fixed and not part of the state;
#  you should do something else to represent the state. However, each Mazeworldproblem
#  might make use of a (single) maze object, modifying it as needed
#  in the process of checking for legal moves.

# Test code at the bottom of this file shows how to load in and display
#  a few maze data files (e.g., "maze1.maz", which you should find in
#  this directory.)

#  the order in a tuple is (x, y) starting with zero at the bottom left

# Maze file format:
#    # is a wall
#    . is a floor
# the command \robot x y adds a robot at a location. The first robot added
# has index 0, and so forth.
