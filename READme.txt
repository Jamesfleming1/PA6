Hello and Welcome to James Fleming's PA6

My maze is randomly colored in Maze.py if you want consistent maze coloring be sure to set the random seed there
To test my algorithms run testPA6.py where you can input the maze and number of moves you would like the robot to make
If you would like to color your own maze the code should run fine with a maze colored with each color being r, g, b, y in the maze respectively
A normal maze from PA2 will work fine and be converted. Don't input any robot command lines, this will be done internally





Thanks!
